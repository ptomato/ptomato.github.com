title: Anomalous surface plasmon dispersion

I manufactured aluminum layers that support surface plasmon pulses which travel faster as their frequency increases.
That's called _anomalous dispersion_ (which doesn't mean it's unexplained &mdash; it's a silly name) and it's used as the basis for all kinds of nifty effects.
