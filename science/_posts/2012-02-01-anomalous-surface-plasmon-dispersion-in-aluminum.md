title: Anomalous surface plasmon dispersion in aluminum

Work in progress: I am manufacturing aluminum layers that support surface plasmons which travel faster as their frequency increases.
That's called _anomalous dispersion_ (anomalous, because usually it's slower) and it's used as the basis for all kinds of nifty effects.
