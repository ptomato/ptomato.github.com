I created a new way to measure the topological charge of an optical vortex without an interferometer, by placing a plasmonic nanostructure in the transverse plane of the beam.
(Roughly speaking, I measure the twistiness of a twisty light beam.)
I used an 'emitter' slit in a metal layer to excite surface plasmons that travel along the metal surface to a 'receiver' slit.
Observing the diffraction yields the topological charge.
