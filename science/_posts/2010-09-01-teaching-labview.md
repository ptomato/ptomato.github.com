From 2010&ndash;2012, I taught LabVIEW to physics and math majors at Leiden University, together with Alex Siemens.
We gave the students the basics of LabVIEW and guided them through the design of a PID controller and a project of their own choosing, in order to prepare them for their experimental research project at the end of their degree.
I also worked on editing the course manual and making sure it was up to date.
