title: Spin-orbit coupling in subwavelength apertures
---
I designed and measured a nanostructure which converts spin angular momentum of light into orbital angular momentum, making use of a [surprising property](#plasmonic-quarter-wave-plate) of subwavelength slits in a metal layer.
I'm preparing a paper that analyzes how the shape of the nanostructure controls the relation between topological charge and orbital angular momentum per photon.
