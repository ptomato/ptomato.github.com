# Python programming #

The future of lightweight scientific computing lies in open source.
I use the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language to analyze my data and do all my calculations, and even to control my measuring instruments wherever possible.-->

I am an experimental physicist, working towards a PhD degree in the [Quantum Optics](http://www.molphys.leidenuniv.nl/qo) group at Leiden University.
This page contains the explanation of my research for non-scientists.
Read it for as long as you're interested and quit as soon as you're not &mdash; I start by explaining the basics and continue on to more complicated things.

# Surface plasmons #

You might know a book called _Flatland_ by one Dr. Edwin Abbott Abbott.
It's a short allegorical tale (you can read it [online](...) and it doesn't take very long) that satirizes the class society and the status of women in late 19th century England.

Abbott wanted to make a better world with his book, but his efforts were mostly forgotten &mdash; society eventually changed, but the world was not ready for _Flatland_.
Perhaps because all the characters were squares, triangles, lines, pentagons, and other polygons, living in a two-dimensional world.

  <img src="/images/flatland.png" alt="A square, triangle, and circle in Flatland" width="300" title="Be there or be square"/>
</div>

However ridiculous, the idea of a two-dimensional world is just cool, and that is probably why _Flatland_ is still read and not consigned to the dustbin of history.

What does all this have to do with my research?
Once you've imagined a two-dimensional world, it's not such a leap anymore.
What we call a **surface plasmon** is the equivalent of a light wave in Flatland.
It's a light wave that is trapped on a flat surface, and so acts like it's two-dimensional.

In real life, surface plasmons can only occur on a metal surface.
So, let's transport our flat friends from the previous illustration to the surface of a mirror.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="/images/flatland-metal.png" alt="Our flat friends from the previous illustration on a mirror" width="300" title="Notice that they have no reflection, because they're evanescent in the z direction."/>
</div>

Let's say that Mr. Triangle there goes to his garden shed and gets his flashlight and shines it at Mr. Hexagon.
A surface plasmon hits Mr. Hexagon full in the face.
However, the surface plasmon behaves just like a two-dimensional light wave &mdash; Mr. Triangle could have bounced it off his two-dimensional bathroom mirror, or focused it with a two-dimensional lens.

To illustrate that researchers actually do this, on the left, you see Mr. Triangle's bathroom mirror, from a 2006 [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.73.155416) by Maria-Ujue Gonzalez et al.
On the right is Mr. Triangle's lens, from a 2010 [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.18.020610) by Elo&iuml;se Devaux et al.
(That paper is open access, so it's free to download and read!)

# Getting three-dimensional light into Flatland #

So the Flatlanders are living happily on their mirror surface.
Let's say we want to wake them up in the middle of the night by shining a flashlight into their houses.
You might think to go about it like this:

<div class="figure">
	<img src="/images/flashlight1.png" alt="Shining a flashlight onto a mirror: it bounces off" width="500" title="The midnight sun!"/>
</div>

But that doesn't work!
The light just bounces off the mirror, like it does from your regular mirror.
To get the light into Flatland, we have to put some sort of device on the mirror surface that transforms light into surface plasmons.
This is usually called **coupling**.

<div class="figure">
	<img src="/images/flashlight2.png" alt="Coupling into Flatland" width="500" title="Coupling into Flatland"/>
</div>

In the illustration above, there is a coupler (drawn simply as a straight line) that transforms the flashlight beam into surface plasmons (shown in red.)
Note that there is no reflection from the flashlight anymore; the beam went into Flatland instead.
