{% comment %}I am an experimental physicist, working towards a PhD degree in the [Quantum Optics](http://www.molphys.leidenuniv.nl/qo) group at Leiden University.

The future of lightweight scientific computing lies in open source.
I use the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language to analyze my data and do all my calculations, and even to control my measuring instruments wherever possible.-->
