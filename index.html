  <strong>Welcome</strong> to Philip Chimento's page.
  I am a <strong>scientist</strong> by profession, <strong>coder</strong> in my spare time, and I do <strong>creative</strong> things too.
  This is a sort of portfolio where I display things I have created in each of these capacities.

  <h1>Science</h1>
  <p>
    I am in the last year of a PhD degree in <strong>physics</strong> at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
    I research <strong>surface plasmons</strong>, which is what happens when a light wave gets stuck on the surface of a metal and starts pretending it lives in Flatland.

  <h1>Programming</h1>
  <p>
    I have a passion for <strong>open source software</strong>.
    In my spare time, I have built several software projects which are available for free on <a href="https://github.com/ptomato">GitHub</a>.
    I also incorporate open source into my scientific research whenever possible, which has spawned some <a href="beams.html">projects</a> in itself.

  <h1>Writing</h1>
  <p>
    I have strong opinions about <strong>science</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, and their <strong>place in society</strong>, and I enjoy writing about them.
    I sometimes indulge in a rant about politics.
