  - name: Inform 7
    website: http://inform7.com
    icon: images/inform7.png
    synopsis: test test
    tags: ['C', 'GTK']
  - name: Chimara
    website: http://www.chimara-if.org
    synopsis: flskjdgk skljfdls kjfklds ajflkdsajfl awefds lkds ds ldsjflsdkafjldks
    tags: ['C', 'GTK', 'Glk']
  - name: Beams
    page: beams
    tagline: A laser beam profiler that also works on cheap webcams
    tags: ['Python', 'SciPy', 'GTK']
    synopsis: Commercial laser beam profilers are expensive although they perform fairly simple calculations and often have horrible user interfaces. An open-source solution designed for inexpensive hardware benefits optics researchers, engineers, and hobbyists everywhere.
  - name: REP
    page: rep
    tagline: Control lab instruments in Python
    tags: ['Python', 'NumPy', 'VISA']
    synopsis: REP makes it easy to interface your lab instruments with your data analysis and visualization tools &mdash; Python, of course! It's a great alternative to LabVIEW if you'd rather script your experiments than fiddle with wires and blocks.
  - name: Advanced GTK Techniques
    page: advanced-gtk-techniques
    tagline: A tutorial for advanced GTK programming
    synopsis: This tutorial is written for people who have passed the stage of learning how to build user interfaces with GTK, and want to know how to program more advanced, real-world applications.
    tags: ['C', 'Mallard']
  - name: Pythonic Meep
    synopsis: dsflkjdlfks
    tags: ['Python', 'C++', 'NumPy']
  - name: Osxcart
    synopsis: Pronounced "ox cart", nvcm, n, msdnsdflksj
    tags: ['C', 'XML', 'GTK']
  - name: GoogleDocs2LaTeX
    synopsis: This one is in need of a better name. slkdf jgdlskfg nrpe jks dnfjlk
    tags: ['Vala', 'XSLT', 'GTK', 'LaTeX']
  - name: CARS Wavelengths
    tagline: Calculate the wavelengths in a coherent anti-Stokes Raman process
    tags: ['C', 'GTK']
    synopsis: I wrote this tiny utility while I was working on my Masters' thesis in order to aid myself in quickly calculating back and forth between wavelengths, frequencies, and wave numbers.
