There's no installer program for **REP**, since I haven't yet found a need to install it on any other computer than my lab computer.
At some point, you will find the installer on this page.

For now, download the package, unzip it, open a terminal, and execute:

{% highlight bash %}
python setup.py install
{% endhighlight %}
