There are Python bindings for [Meep](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Meep), MIT's finite-difference time domain electric field simulator, but in my opinion they don't take enough advantage of what Python offers &mdash; they require (shudder) _manual memory management!_
This is a proof of concept I wrote, to demonstrate that it really is possible to use Meep in a Pythonic way.
