It's the 21st century.
{% include latex.html %} may be the best possible typesetting system for scientific articles, but scientists don't want to type markup by hand anymore.
These days, we want tools that allow us to write easily and collaboratively.
Articulate lets you write your articles in Google Docs, while still using {% include latex.html %}'s excellent facilities for math formulas and sticking to the principle of <abbr title="What You See Is What You Mean">WYSIWYM</abbr>.
Then, convert them to {% include latex.html %} with only a few clicks, ready to typeset and submit to a journal!
