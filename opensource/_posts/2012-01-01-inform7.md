Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural language.
It's tightly integrated with its own GUI development environment.
When it was first released, this GUI was only available for Windows and Mac.
I built one for Linux, which was eventually adpoted as the project's official Linux GUI.
(This was what got me interested in open source in the first place!)
