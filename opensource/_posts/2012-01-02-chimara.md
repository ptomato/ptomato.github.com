Co-designed with my former neighbor [Marijn van Vliet](https://twitter.com/#!/wmvanvliet), this project is a GTK implementation of the [Glk I/O standard](http://eblong.com/zarf/glk/) for interactive fiction.
We designed it with two purposes: powering the embedded viewer in Inform, and viewing interactive fiction on the iRex iLiad e-reader.
