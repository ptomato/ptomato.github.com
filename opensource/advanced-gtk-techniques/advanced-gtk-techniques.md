This is a tutorial for advanced [GTK](http://www.gtk.org/) programming.
It is written for people who have passed the stage of learning how GTK works and want to know how to program more advanced, real-world applications.
Things that will be covered include creating your own widgets and cell renderers, writing dynamic user interfaces, and more.

If you need to learn how GTK works, I heartily recommend GNOME's [ten-minute tutorials](http://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/unstable/).

This tutorial isn't finished yet, I'm working on it.
You can follow along while it's a work in progress, though.
Both the code and the website are hosted on Github, so if you see a mistake, you can report it there, or just change it yourself and send me a pull request.
