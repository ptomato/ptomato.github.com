**Beams** is a camera program for scientists and engineers who work with lasers.

I developed **Beams** in a quick-and-dirty, incremental way, **in the lab.**
Anytime I needed to do a particular measurement, I added that capability to **Beams.**
This means it's immensely practical, because every time some part of the program gets in my way, **I fix it.**

**Beams** is **under construction**, but I figured I'd share it instead of keeping it to myself.
