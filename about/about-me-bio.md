My name is Philip Chimento.
I'm generally a geek.
I moved from the USA to the Netherlands at the age of 12 along with my parents, brothers and sisters.
We all learned to speak Dutch, but everybody else except me eventually moved back.

I do research in the physics department of Leiden University in the Netherlands.
Technically, I'm in graduate school, but in the Dutch system getting a PhD is a job, not school.
Next year I'll be graduating and so I'm looking for a **job**.
That's why this bio reads mostly like a résumé. <span class="note">(And that's why I made this website in the first place &mdash; as a sort of portfolio.)</span>

# Career goal #

**Making tools**: interfaces between a difficult task and a user who needs an easier abstraction. I can sink my teeth into something complicated, but I can also take a step back and condense it into a form others can work with. In other words, I want to work on things that people use, in a job where I can deal with both the technical side and the human side of technology.

What does that mean in terms of the actual **job** I'm looking for?
I'd like to work

- as a software engineer, designing tools for research, preferably with affinity towards open source;
- in physics (optics) research, in a team doing something cool;
- as a software engineer, in the field of scientific computing.

I'm interested in relocating to **Canada**.

# Disambiguation #

I have the same name as my father.
