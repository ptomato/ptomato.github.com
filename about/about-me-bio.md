# Career goal #

Iâ€™ve worked as a physicist for several years now, and practiced software engineering as a hobby.
I've discovered that although I love research, at heart I'm more of a **toolmaker**.
I want to use my experience to improve the software tools available to scientists and researchers.

What does that mean in terms of the actual **job** I'm looking for?
I'd like to work

- as a software engineer, designing tools for research, preferably with affinity towards open source;
- in physics (optics) research, in a team doing something cool;
- as a software engineer, in the field of scientific computing.
