# Computer programming #

I have been interested in computer programming since childhood.
I enjoy contributing to various [**open source** projects](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/ptomato/positions), including several [I wrote myself](/opensource/projects.html).
Automating [lab measurements](/opensource/rep/rep.html) and data analysis got me interested in **scientific computing**.

I am especially proficient in **C**, **Python**, and **LabVIEW**, but I also know **Matlab**, **C++**, **Java**, **Perl**, and **others**, and I learn new programming languages for breakfast.

# Science communication #

I am interested in effective science communication, on all different levels, from popular to academic, using tools such as data visualization, illustrations, and well-written language.
Designing both the **content** and the **aesthetic** of scientific writing appeals to me.

# Design #

I have an eye for good design, typography, and calligraphy, which has found its way into posters, websites, dissertations, computer user interfaces, and other things throughout the years.
I have mastered several graphics and DTP programs, such as **Adobe InDesign**.

# Presentation skills #

Experience in several amateur theater groups has taught me skills in **oral presentation**, **public speaking**, and dealing with an **audience**.
(And I even learned to play an instrument.)

# Language #

- **English** (native speaker)
- **Dutch** (near-native)
- **German** (basic)
- **French** (rudimentary)
